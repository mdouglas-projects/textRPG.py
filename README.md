# Hero Adventure Game 🗡️🛡️

**Description:**  
This is my very first Python project, created on my third day of learning Python!  
It's a **terminal-based adventure game**, where you create your hero, explore caves, and fight enemies like Goblins and Skeletons.  
This project was built to practice **basic Python concepts** such as classes, functions, loops, and control flow.
